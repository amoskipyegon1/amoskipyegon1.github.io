Hey, I'm Amos Kipyegon, a software developer with a knack for building awesome things.

Currently crafting robust backend services and exploring system design challenges. I find joy in building things that make a difference, whether it's a high-performance server, an intuitive frontend, or elegant database solutions.

My toolkit includes Go for backend systems, TypeScript for web applications, Python for quick solutions, and C++ when performance really matters. I believe in choosing the right tool for the job and learning whatever is necessary to solve the problem at hand.
